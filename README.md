## Project Description

In this project, we had to create a portfolio to display all of our projects and allow employers to look at our work. This will allow us to share our projects and show our React js skills

## User Story

```
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```
